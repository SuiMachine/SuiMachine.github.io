Hey Mods, This isn't a Copy Paste, but I just wanted to let you know, you're all Nazi Mods. Thanks, and stop. It's not cool. If I wanted you to ban me, I would post giant E-Peens of ASCII art, but I don't, so don't. That's not cool. I would prefer it if you actually learned to be a mod instead of being a Nazi. Nazi was the cause of a World War, do we really need the 3rd one already? So, just stop. Thanks, and stop.
just wanted to remind everyone that if you think you have a video game addiction that is impairing your ability to succeed in school, work, or relationship you may be diagnosed with an addiction and it is honestly worthwhile to speak with a therapist to help you out. nothing wrong with it.
Consider having your kids play games on a console instead of a PC. Consoles offer you much more control over privacy, content and security settings, while children may miss much easier these restrictions in a computer. When choosing a console for your use, you are making the choice to keep your children protected.
if you say "mike uyama" 3 times in front of the bathroom mirror he'll show up in your dreams playing marvel heroes
SO this sounds rude, mostly because it is to be honest, but does this run actaully require any amounth of skill or is it just glitching to give yourself a bunch of stats to be able to one short everything and then jsut sequence skip half the game? sounds like a pretty terrible speedrun to be perfectly honest
well i did find some tricks what im not sharing still but i can get wr but i fogot all the glitch so yeah
I don't know what the HK marathon started as, but now we are going to be the one online marathon that actually cares about quality and not beigng a meme
I sexually Identify as a scampering rat. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of scurrying over the rooftops dropping hot sticky dodges on disgusting fat guys. People say to me that a person being a rat is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install a tail, whiskers and little paws on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Dirty Rat" and respect my right to dodge from above and elbow needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a musophobe and need to check your rodent privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
Sorry for the children in the chat. I shall smite them with my dragon powers. *uses fire breath on all the trouble makers in chat*
If you are having mods that are constantly trolling and relentlessly spamming terrible memes (good memes are fine), the chat will follow suit and your chat will become terrible.
Apparently all the games that use heavy mechanics have been served to male interest, since they dont appeal to females, then women have a disadvantage to playing the new game. aka. guys have this back catalog of understanding about game mechanics because games have been tailored to interest them at the expense of women. so anita said its time to reset that favoritism. treat the player as if they did not have a deep understanding of game mechanics. so you have unlocking.
It's hilarious u kids talking shit about Catalyst. u wouldn't say shit to him at lan, he's jacked. Not only that be he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
I'd like to remind you that Star Wars games in general have no good audio balancing.
