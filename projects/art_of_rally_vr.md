Art of Rally VR hack is a BepInEx 6, HarmonyX and OpenVR based hack that I used as a learning project for converting a flatscreen game to VR.

During the project's developement I have learnt how to build camera prefab, rework menu's canvases to work in world-space and VR and how to hook code related to camera and events to allow for comfortable VR experience.

The hack isn't perfect, but it is playable and generally - excluding the lack of VR controller interaction - at the level of other hacks.

Here are some examples of it at work:

For fun, I have also made some changes for the camera that can be enabled manually, although these changes are not recommended to be used:
