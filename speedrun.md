Here are some nice comments about speedruns:

```
you run with speedhack you idiot
NO! STOP IT. This is not how the game was intended to be played!!! you are insulting the devs!!!
Speedrunning is so dumb when it comes to story-based games like this. Take time to enjoy the story, world and gameplay. The only games that speedrunning is sensible for are games like the original Super Mario Bros. or the Sonic games.
Still reporting on straight up glitching/cheating as if it means anything, huh. No one cares about speedruns. Their only legitimacy is that they are involved with ADGQ. Guess what, you could also legitimately play a game through as fast as possible and raise money. Speedrunners are not real gamers.
