<img align="left" src="/images/avatar.jpg" hspace="5px"> Hi! I am Sui. I work as a Unity programmer by day, but in my spare time I am larping as hacker foxboy.

In here I am trying to write about things that interest me, but due to lack of time (or energy) I don't write that much. I am PCGamingWiki contributor, occasionally a speedrunner. Since 6 years old I was interested in computers and after much struggle with depression managed to get to a point in life when I landed a job as Unity programmer working on SimRail.

My original character was designed by [Tsuno](https://x.com/Tsuuuno2) 💚 and debuted in on December 13, 2025 and is meant to represent things I have been through life and my hope that I can help keep the software running in the future.

I gather references to 0451 and am a huge fan of immersive sims.
