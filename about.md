<img align="left" src="/images/avatar.jpg" hspace="5px"> This a GitHub blog of SuicideMachine (or SuiMachine for politically correct puritans). Currently a full-time Unity Programmer in Katowice, Poland. Since I was 6, I have shown a very clear interest in all things computer and gaming related.
I am a PCGamingWiki moderator, occasionally a speedrunner and shitposter.
