I guess one could describe ''No, I'm not a Human'' as kind of advanced choose your own adventure game with a bit of randomization. Concept is simple - some monsters have appeared that will come into your house and kill you if you are alone - so you need to let someone in, but who do you let in? During that FEMA is quickly formed  to help to control the crisis and study Visitors offering possibly cluses on how to identify them. A phone number? 0-00-451!
