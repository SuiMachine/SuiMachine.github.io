Fortune's Run is a fast pace first-person shooter mixed with stealth... maybe immersive sim for some (certainly way of im sim than most of the titles that tried to advertise themselves as such in the last year). Whatever you see it as immersive sim or not - it still takes a lot of inspirations from Deus Ex or EYE Divine Cybermancy (per developer's words) and it just wouldn't be complete with 0451 put somewhere as an easter egg - here, a classic, which is: Open the door with keypad in a tutorial segment - code is somewhere in the enviroment. Good stuff!
