Still Wakes the Deep is a horror game developed by The Chinese Room. It's far from being an immersive sim or even something with hub-like design similar to Amnesia - just a linear game. In the first hour of so of the game, you end up picking a fire-extinguisher and putting out some fires, which gets you an achievement "Fahrenheit 0451" - which woud be probably accidental if it wasn't for the 0 at the beginning.
