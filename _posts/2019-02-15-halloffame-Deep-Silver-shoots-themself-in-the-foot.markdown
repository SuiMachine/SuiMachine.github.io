If it wasn't clear enough that Deep Silver pulled out the whole Epic Store exclusivity stunt, now we have this. I honest have never expected to see a publisher shoot themselves in the foot so hard. It's like, as if you were to shoot yourself in the foot with an anti-tank cannon it should not ever happen... and yet Deep Silver being so incompetent managed to pull it off. GG!
