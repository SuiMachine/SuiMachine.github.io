Coming out from Mundfish - a developer with spotty history, Atomic Heart is a Immersive Sim-lite somewhat similar to Bioshock, which sadly lacks some of the self-awareness in order not to bore the player towards his/her experience with the game. Ironically, this lack of self-awareness carries over to how its 0451 reference was implemented - as in, an in-your-face line right at the beginning of the game, which is imidietly left and abandoned (somewhat like the one in Mafia 3). Oh well.
