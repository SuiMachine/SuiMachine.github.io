Coming from Eidos Montreal, who previously managed to make 2 great Deus Ex sequels after the further sequels got canceled - Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy also features a 0451 easter egg. This time as a code to a Nova Corps' security grid, which you enter really early on in the game.

Thanks to [kynapse](https://github.com/kynapse) and TrakkDay for reminding me and providing screenshots.
