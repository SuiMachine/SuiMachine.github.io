Peripeteia, currently in Early Access, is a Polish indie immersive sim inspired by Deus Ex and games from Looking Glass Studios. Unsurprisingly, during the 2nd mission, in which we are asked to eliminate Jakub Franciszek, we may eventually come across a PC that requires us to enter a login and password. While I won't spoil the login, the password turns out to be 0451.
