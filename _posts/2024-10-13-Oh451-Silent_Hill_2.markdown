The Silent Hill 2 remake had a pretty high bar to clear. The original 2001 game is a cult classic, filled with complex narrative elements and not-so-obvious symbolism. The remake not only had to attract a new generation of fans, but also satisfy the vast majority of old ones with new content. Did it succeed? In my opinion, yes.

One of the things it added, however, was a little digital safe puzzle at the motel, where one of the notes hides a well-known combination - 0451.
