So few weeks ago I had a bit of a fun with Speedrun API, where usually during a day I did around 10k to 30k requests, gathering all sort of pointless informations, usually with a hopes of finding really awkward leaderboards.

Results of my work, were gathered in few different Pastebin documents, which are accessible by clicking on the corresponding links.
