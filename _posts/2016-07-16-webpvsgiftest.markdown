For a long time, I haven't been a fan of Gif as a format. Yes it serves its purpose, but for me - it's clearly outdated and while many websites kind of bypass it's limitations, when displaying animations, by using formats like FLV and WEBM - which are movie formats, I thought, I'd for once show some power of WebP - especially that I've written a simple GUI to make converting animations from image sequence to WebP, easier and avoid using GIF on the way.

And what's a better way to show WebP power over GIF, than using it in comparison, where normal Gif just dies - that is tons of colors. So I found 24bitdepth image on the internet and made animated gif with it.

So here are the results:

> ![anim.gif](/images/webpvsgif/anim.gif) - GIF (7.93MB)

> ![anim.webp](/images/webpvsgif/anim.webp) - WEBP (2.63MB)

And I think that proves the WebP superior in this case ;)
